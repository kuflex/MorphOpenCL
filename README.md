===========
This is example of using OpenCL for creating particle system,
which morphs between two 3D shapes - cube and face image

Control keys: 1 - morph to cube, 2 - morph to face

All drawn particles have equal brightness, so to achieve face-like
particles configuration by placing different number of particles
at each pixel and draw them in "addition blending" mode.

Project is developed for openFrameworks 8.4_osx and is based
on example-Particles example of ofxMSAOpenCL adoon.
It uses addons ofxMSAOpenCL and ofxMSAPingPong.
For simplicity this addons are placed right in the project's folder.
